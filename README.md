Hi bois n' gi√ªls.
Soo, I'm making repos once in a year or such lmao,
mainly 3DS homebrew or C (and a bit of Cpp) code in general.
Yea, not much to say, exept that IF NEEDED (Please concider asking your questions in GitHub), you can contact me on Discord : BrebisSolide#5066
Also, don't forget that i'm new to the world of homebrews, so don't expect to see amazing things on there.
